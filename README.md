#System Setup
This project makes use of BaseJump STL and the hammer flow for which we need to run the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/bsg-external/ee477-hammer-cad.git
cd ee477-hammer-cad.git
make

Once this passes,
cd ..

Make a fresh directory <YOURDIR> in which you can clone this repo.


This is a temporary branch which is created to test logic with potential bsg ip replacements.
